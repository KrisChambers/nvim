# NeoVim Configs

My NeoVim dotfiles

# Plugins not all necessarily enabled

## Avante
Cursor like AI Assistant.
- Pretty buggy, but has been useful.

## Copilot (Disabled)
Microsoft AI Assitant

## Fugitive
Great plugin for an easy git workflow

## Haskell-tools
Collection of tools for writing haskell
Can be a bit finicky with also using Mason and GhcUP

## LazyDev
Tools for developing lazy plugins (i think?)

## LSP
Bunch of LSP plugins:
- Mason for downloading and managing LSPs and linting / debugging tools.
- Various cmp-* plugins for managing servers
- lsp setup for various languages (rust, terraform, python, haskell, lua)

## Markdown
Renders Markdown in the terminal
- Styling can feel a bit cluttered but it is conveniant.

## Telescope
Fuzzy find: files, buffers, files in git, grep contents of all files. Just awesome
- Requires ripgrep to be installed

## Theme
Few themes I test out

## Treesitter
Provides some nice extras to syntax highlighting.
- Want to build something against this

## Debug Adapter Protocol
Simliar to LSPs but for Debuggers. Installed but not really used right now.

## Lualine
Provides better contextual information about the buffer / file.

## OrgMode
Emac's OrgMode implemented in Neovim. Experimenting with it. Really digging it.

## Refactor
Primagen's refactor plugin. Haven't really took the time to play around with this too much. But it does seem to have
some nice features that are missing by default when doing refactors across many files
